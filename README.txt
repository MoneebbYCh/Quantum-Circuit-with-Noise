This project provides a Python script to simulate a quantum circuit using the Cirq library and visualize the resulting states of qubits.

##RECOMMENDED
I would highly recommend to run this on google collab even if you are using LINUX. You can always use a browser to access google collab.
If not, then you may follow the steps as provided to run this on a LINUX OS.

##Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your Linux system:
- Python 3
- pip (Python package installer)

##Installation

You can Youtube how to install these.


## Save the Script
Create a new file for the script. For example:
nano quantum_bloch_sphere.py


## Run the Script
Execute the script using Python:
python3 quantum_bloch_sphere.py
This will run the script and display the Bloch spheres for the qubits.
